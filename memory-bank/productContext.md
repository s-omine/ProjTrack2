# Product Context: ProjTrack2

## Why This Project Exists
This project serves as a comprehensive starter/template for developers who want to build AI-powered applications that integrate:
- Modern web frontends
- AI agent backends
- Seamless state synchronization
- Dynamic UI generation
- Interactive user workflows

## Problems It Solves
1. **Development Speed**: Provides a working template for AI-integrated apps
2. **State Management**: Demonstrates real-time state sync between frontend and backend
3. **AI Integration**: Shows how to properly structure AI agent interactions
4. **User Experience**: Demonstrates best practices for AI-driven UIs

## Target Users
- Developers building AI-powered applications
- Teams integrating CopilotKit into their projects
- Developers learning PydanticAI framework

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Interactions
1. **Proverbs Management**
   - Users can ask the AI to add, read, or remove proverbs
   - State is synchronized between frontend display and agent knowledge
   - Real-time updates on both sides

2. **Theme Customization**
   - AI can change the application theme color
   - Users see immediate visual feedback
   - Demonstrates AI control over UI

3. **Weather Queries**
   - AI generates dynamic weather cards
   - UI components created on-demand
   - Shows generative UI capabilities

4. **Critical Actions**
   - Moon mission requires user approval
   - Demonstrates human oversight for AI actions
   - Shows best practices for sensitive operations

## How It Should Work
1. User opens the application (Next.js frontend)
2. Agent server starts (Python backend with PydanticAI)
3. CopilotKit connects frontend and backend
4. User chats with AI through CopilotKit sidebar
5. AI can perform actions that affect UI or state
6. User sees real-time updates and can approve/reject critical actions

## Key Features Demonstration
- **State Management**: Proverbs list managed by AI, visible to user
- **Generative UI**: Weather cards generated based on AI requests
- **Frontend Actions**: Theme colors changed by AI
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Mission launch requires user confirmation
- **Interactive Suggestions**: Chat interface with example prompts
