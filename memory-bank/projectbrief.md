# Project Brief: ProjTrack2

## Project Overview
**ProjTrack2** is an AI-powered web application that demonstrates the integration of PydanticAI agents with CopilotKit for building modern, interactive AI experiences.

## Project Goal
Create a working demonstration of AI agents that can:
- Manage shared state between frontend and backend
- Generate dynamic UI components
- Execute frontend actions
- Require human confirmation for sensitive operations

## Core Requirements
1. **AI Agent Backend**: Python-based agent using PydanticAI
2. **Modern Frontend**: Next.js application with React and CopilotKit
3. **State Synchronization**: Real-time state management between frontend and backend
4. **Interactive UI**: Generative components that can be created and managed by the AI
5. **User Control**: Human-in-the-loop workflows for critical actions

## Success Criteria
- AI agent can read and modify shared state
- Frontend can trigger agent tools
- AI can generate dynamic UI components
- AI can manipulate frontend directly
- Users can approve or reject AI-initiated actions

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.3.2, React 19, CopilotKit 1.10.6, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Python 3.12+, PydanticAI, FastAPI/Uvicorn
- **AI Model**: OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Package Management**: npm/pnpm for Node.js, uv for Python

## Current Status
✅ Complete implementation of all core features
✅ Working AI agent with state management
✅ Generative UI components
✅ Frontend actions
✅ Human-in-the-loop workflows
